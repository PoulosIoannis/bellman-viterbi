# Burst Detection with Viterbi and Bellman Algorithms

This tool detects bursts in sequences of message offsets (time gaps between events) using two algorithms:
- **Viterbi-based burst detection**.
- **Bellman ford-based dynamic programming**.

## 🔍 Purpose

To analyze timestamped events (e.g. messages, posts) and identify periods of increased activity (bursts).

## 📥 Input

A plain text file with space-separated time intervals (offsets), choose one of the txt's:two_states.txt,three_states.txt,four_states.txt
